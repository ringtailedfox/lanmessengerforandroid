Option 1: Interactive Prompt Script

This version asks questions step-by-step:

#!/bin/bash

echo "Choose architecture (e.g., armv7, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64):"
read ARCH

echo "Choose operating system (e.g., android, linux, win32):"
read OS

echo "Choose version (e.g., 4.0, 13, win7):"
read VERSION

BUILD_STRING="${ARCH}-${OS}-${VERSION}"
echo "Building for: $BUILD_STRING"

# Call your build logic here
./build_apks.sh --build="$BUILD_STRING"

You could even loop and ask:

echo "Any other combinations to compile for? (y/n)"
